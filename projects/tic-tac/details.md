### Tic Tac Advertisement - Sound Design & Music

A conceptual sound design and music project for a Tic Tac advertisement, created as part of group work.

**Concept & Insights:**
The core rhythmic and sonic identity was built entirely from recorded Tic Tac sounds (shaking, opening, individual mint sounds) and related foley effects mimicking the character transformations.

*   **Rhythm:** Highly syncopated beat with progressively increasing intensity.
*   **Instrumentation:** Classic advertising band elements were added, including electric bass, funky guitars, drums, and horns, complementing the Tic Tac-based rhythm.
*   **Synchronization:** Sounds are tightly synchronized to the visual actions (audioreactive).

Two versions were created: one focusing purely on the Tic Tac foley rhythm and another mixing it with the full instrumental arrangement.
