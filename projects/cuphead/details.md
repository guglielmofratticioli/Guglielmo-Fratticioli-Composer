### â˜• CupHead - Soundtrack Recreation

A fun exercise in recreating the distinct vintage Big Band Swing and Dixieland Jazz style of the CupHead game soundtrack for a gameplay and results screen sequence.

**Tracks Created:**
*   **Battle Scene BigBand Swing!:** An energetic, brass-heavy track designed for intense boss fights, capturing the chaotic fun of the game.
*   **Results Overview Dixieland Jazz:** A more laid-back, ragtime-influenced piece suitable for the level completion screen.

**Learning & Process:**
This project involved studying the specific instrumentation and arrangement techniques of 1930s jazz. I also experimented further with virtual Big Band instruments while learning the style, resulting in an additional demo track.

**Time to Make:** Approximately 25-40 hours (1 week).
