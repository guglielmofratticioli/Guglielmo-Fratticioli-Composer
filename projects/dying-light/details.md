### ðŸ§Ÿ Dying Light 2 - Sound Redesign

This was a comprehensive sound redesign project for a trailer/cutscene from Dying Light 2. My goal was to create a tense, action-packed, and immersive audio experience.

**Scope & Process:**
*   **Foley:** Replaced and enhanced character movements, impacts, and environmental interactions.
*   **Ambience:** Crafted multi-layered atmospheres fitting the post-apocalyptic urban setting.
*   **Voiceover:** Recorded and heavily processed custom zombie vocalizations (yes, that's my voice!).
*   **Music:** Composed original cinematic music pieces shifting between suspenseful exploration, intense action ("Hospital Trap" beat, "Action Orchestra"), and apocalyptic storytelling ("Telling Apocalypse").
*   **Sound Effects:** Designed custom metallic impacts (using recorded keys), swooshes (synthesized), fire sounds, and horror stingers to punctuate key moments.

**Time to Make:** Approximately 30-50 hours (1.5 weeks).
