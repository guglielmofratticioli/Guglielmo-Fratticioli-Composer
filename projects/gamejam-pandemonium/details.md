### 🏆 Game Jam: Pandemonium - Soundtrack & SFX

Soundtrack and sound effects created for the game "Pandemonium", developed during the 24Frame Videogames Hackathon (3rd Edition, 2024).

**Outcome:** Our team won **First Prize (Judges Award)!** 🎉

**Contribution:**
*   Helped define the game concept.
*   Produced the main soundtrack, mixing an energetic Drum & Bass beat with comical, cartoon-like sound effects (inspired by shows like "Paperissima Sprint") to create a fun, chaotic, and parodic feeling fitting the game's theme.
*   Provided various sound effects integrated into the gameplay.

The entire audio package was created within the tight 8-hour time limit of the game jam.
